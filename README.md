Welcome to Mini-LLaVA â€“ a minimal and seamless implementation of LLaVA-style vision language model, which unlock multimodal ability of a Large Language Model (based on Llama-3.1) with just a single GPU.

This project goes above and beyond the original by introducing powerful support for interleaved processing of multiple input typesâ€”including images, videos, and textâ€”all respecting their order of appearance. Whether you're handling complex visual-textual correlations or want seamless transitions between media formats, Mini-LLaVA has you covered with minimal code and maximum flexibility.


## ðŸ”¥ Updates
- [09/2024] [Minimal Implementation] [Tutorial in Mini_LLaVA.ipynb](Mini_LLaVA.ipynb) showing how a pre-trained adaptor could helps Llama3.1 to see.


## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Minimal Code Structure: Transform a language model (Llama 3.1) into a powerful vision-language model with minimal, easy-to-understand code.
- Simplified Implementation: Our code is significantly simpler than the original LLaVA implementation, making it easier to dive into and build upon.
- Extended Functionality: We've added support for interleaved processing of images, videos, and text, giving you more flexibility and power.

## ðŸš§ TODO 
- [ ] Fine-tune on language decoder
- [ ] Audio modality
- [ ] Retrieval modality
- [ ] Benchmark inference test


## Environment Set-up
```shell
bash set.sh
```
